# Data-Visualization-Reporting
The purpose of the airline safety statistics case study is to present the storytelling with data. I have created Infographics, Blogpost, Power BI and PowerPoint presentation as part of the storytelling for this case study. The report will be able to illustrate that there has been significant drop in airline fatalities after 1999 while vehicle fatalities has been growing over the years. With recent plane crash around the world that killed hundreds of people and the missing of MH370, travelers might question whether flying has become less safe. Aviation expert sees the recent incidents are a fraction of what they were as recently as the 1990s and the other transportation mode such as vehicles. The study is to investigate the data and submit the report of the findings.
